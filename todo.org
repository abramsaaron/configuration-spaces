* give things better names
  - firstcoordinate
  - coh2
* make sure red dot matches red edge, resp.
* add individual neighborhood forces to nodes depending on labels
* enable user to move node freely around while the rest is frozen
* add dots
* make more efficient
** cooling down and heating up when changes happen
* make the config space look better
* make grid with nodes (with forces) from squares
* upload to git and share
* have a version online
* interactivity: add / delete nodes and edges
* interactivity: user move dots around
* interactivity: add / delete dots
* animation: move dots randomly (on either side)
* animation to show Euler path in graph
* catalog of nice graphs
* fix the font
* toggle 2D/3D in the space
* fix mouseReleased outside of canvas

DONE

* mark squares better (grid view)
* discern types of edges in config space: pair-singleton OR singleton-pair
* center the graphs (not with force)Â´
